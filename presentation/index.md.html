# Virtual Machines Cont.

- Cons
    - Slower
    - More Resource usage
    - Harder migration
    - Needs Configure
    - ...
- Pros
    - Better Control
    - KVM
    - Much much stable and tested over years
    - ...

# Why Developers Care


- A clean, safe, hygienic, portable runtime environment for your app.
- No worries about missing dependencies, packages and other pain points during subsequent deployments.
- Run each app in its own isolated container, so you can run various versions of libraries and other dependencies for each app without worrying.
## Build once... (finally) run anywhere
- Automate testing, integration, packaging...anything you can script.
- Reduce/eliminate concerns about compatibility on different platforms, either your own or your customers.
- Cheap, zero-penalty containers to deploy services. A VM without the overhead of a VM. Instant replay and reset of image snapshots.

---

# Why Administrators Care


- Make the entire lifecycle more efficient, consistent, and repeatable
- Increase the quality of code produced by developers.
- Eliminate inconsistencies between development, test, production, and customer environments.
## Configure once... run anything
- Support segregation of duties.
- Significantly improves the speed and reliability of continuous deployment and continuous integration systems.
- Because the containers are so lightweight, address significant performance, costs, deployment, and portability issues normally associated with VMs.
