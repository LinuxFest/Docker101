# Part I: An overview of visualization platforms

# Virtual Machines

.i-md[

]

- Includes the application, the necessary binaries and libraries and an entire guest operating system 
- all of which may be tens of GBs in size.

# Virtual Machines Cont.

- Cons
    - Slower
    - More Resource usage
    - Harder migration
    - Needs Configure
    - ...
- Pros
    - Better Control
    - KVM
    - Much much stable and tested over years
    - ...

# Part II: Introduction to containers

---

# History: Chroot and Jails

- Linux: Chroot
    - Start the filesystem root here
- BSD: Jails
    - More strict way of limiting user access to the system
    - jailbreak ?? :)

#Containers

.i-md[
![](img/container.png) 
]

- Containers include the application and all of its dependencies
- They Share the kernel with other containers. 
- They run as an isolated process in userspace on the host operating system.
- They’re also not tied to any specific infrastructure 
– Docker containers run on any computer, on any infrastructure and in any cloud.


---

#Cgroups

## Namespaces
-Provide the isolated workspace we call the container. 
-When you run a container, Docker creates a set of namespaces for that container.
### including ..
- The *pid* namespace: Process isolation (PID: Process ID).
- The *net* namespace: Managing network interfaces (NET: Networking).
- The *ipc* namespace: Managing access to IPC resources (IPC: InterProcess Communication).
- The *mnt* namespace: Managing mount-points (MNT: Mount).
- The *uts* namespace: Isolating kernel and version identifiers. (UTS: Unix Timesharing System).

- Features
    - Kernel namespaces (ipc, uts, mount, pid, network and user)
    - Apparmor and SELinux profiles
    - Seccomp policies
    - Chroots (using pivot_root)
    - Kernel capabilities
    - CGroups (control groups)
